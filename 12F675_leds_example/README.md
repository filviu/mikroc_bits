12F675 example
==============

I have a small example that should get you going with the PIC
12F675 microcontroller and mikroC PRO. I am using the
EasyPIC5 development board but I am sure you can adapt it to many
development systems. It's just a small introduction you can use
as a tutorial on getting started with a comon, cheap and simple
microcontroller.
